[Soul Invaders - Daniel Irons SEI Project 1](https://dnirns.github.io/SEI-project-1/)

## Overview:

This was my first project, made 3 weeks into the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.
A space Invaders based game *Soul Inhabitants*, created solo with only vanilla JavaScrip, CSS and HTML in just one week.


## Timeframe:

7 days, solo.

## Technologies Used:

* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML
* CSS
* Git / GitHub
* Adobe Photoshop for animating the sprites.
* Adobe Audition for editing music and sound effects.

## Technical Requirements:

* Render a game in the browser.
* Design logic for winning and visually display that the player has won.
* Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
* KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.


## Game controls:

* Left and right arrows to move your space ship.
* Space bar to shoot.

## Technical Process:

* I made sure to plan the game as much as possible in advace and break it down into stages:
	* Breaking down the game and the main elements that I would need to include.
	* Coming up with a stylistic concept and wireframing a basic visual plan for the finished game.
	* Writing pseudo-code for the logic to get the most essential parts of the game working.
	* Starting to code the game, working from the most general elements and gradually filling in the more complex parts of the game until the main structure was intact and functioning properly.
	* Moving on to adding styling with basic CSS.
	* Fine tuning logic and handling of DOM elements.
	* Allowing time towards the end to add more complex visual elements, including animating sprites with Photoshop and editing sound effects and music with Adobe Audition, then working these into the existing game to replace the more basic placeholder elements.


## Key Learnings:

I learnt a lot about how to break down problems into parts in order to look at things from differenet logical view points.

It opened up my eyes to the possibilities that are avaliable to you when you’re able to manipulate code and apply different kinds of logic in order to translate your ideas into a real life functioning app.

## Challenges:

After only 3 being three weeks into the course, this was initially a big challenge - there were a lot of brand new concepts to put into practice.

Once I had the basic grid layed out and the player responding to keyboard events, the most difficult part to get working correctly was the logic for the enemies movement across the grid. Specifically when they touched the edge of the grid and had to move down one layer closer to the player sprite.


Unfortunately I ran out of time to get the logic for the enemies shooting back at the player to work properly, so this isn’t in the finished game.

##### Code example of the final logic for all of the emenies movement:

## Win:

It was hugely rewarding to get over the hurdles that I came across during the development of the game, and the feeling of satisfaction (even though it’s not 100% finished) was amazing after having only started learning to code just 3 weeks earlier.
